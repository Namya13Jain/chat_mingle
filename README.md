# Problem Statement
In India, the share of elderly people is more than 10% of the population, and among them also one out of every four elder person is lonely. This is due to the erosion of our traditional values to stay with our old parents. Their children leave them to succeed in their lives, forgetting that their parents need their love, care and support. Due to these reasons, a lot of them suffer from depression and related disorders. Here are some news reports as well:

# Future Scope
1. We will be adding medication reminders that allows immediate family members to record and schedule personalized voice messages so that they do not miss out any medicines.
2. We will also offer the option for the immediate family members to track the location of their loved ones suffering from Alzeimers disease and dementia, through just their phones. 
3. Multi-language support Some of our old buddies may not be as comfortable communicating in the English language. So to ease out the navigation through our app, we will be providing multi-language support in various languages such as Hindi, Bengali and Marathi.
