# Problem Statement
In India, the share of elderly people is more than 10% of the population, and among them also one out of every four elder person is lonely. This is due to the erosion of our traditional values to stay with our old parents. Their children leave them to succeed in their lives, forgetting that their parents need their love, care and support. Due to these reasons, a lot of them suffer from depression and related disorders. Here are some news reports as well:

# Tech Stacks Used
Flutter SDK using Dart Language  is used to develop the front end of the application. 

# Marketing Strategy
1. Targeted advertising: Advertise the app on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, targeting users aged 60 and above, as well as their adult children who may be looking for support services for their parents. This can be done through targeted advertising campaigns that focus on the app's key features and benefits.

2. Partnerships with senior living communities: Partner with senior living communities and assisted living facilities to offer the app as a value-added service for their residents. This can help promote the app to a captive audience who are already interested in services that support senior care and wellbeing.

3. Local outreach: Conduct outreach programs in local communities and senior centers to promote the app and its features. This can include informational sessions, workshops, and social events that highlight the app's features and benefits.

4. Referral programs: Implement a referral program that incentivizes users to invite their friends and family members to join the app. This can be done through rewards such as discounts on service fees, free service hours, or other perks.

5. Influencer marketing: Partner with senior influencers and bloggers to promote the app on social media and other online platforms. This can help raise awareness of the app among senior audiences who are already engaged with content related to aging and senior care.

Overall, these strategies can help promote Aging Together to the target audience and raise awareness of the app's unique features and benefits. By leveraging a combination of targeted advertising, local outreach, referral programs, and influencer marketing, the app can reach a wide audience and establish itself as a leading provider of senior care services.
# Future Scope
1. We will be adding medication reminders that allows immediate family members to record and schedule personalized voice messages so that they do not miss out any medicines.

2. We will also offer the option for the immediate family members to track the location of their loved ones suffering from Alzeimers disease and dementia, through just their phones. 

3. Multi-language support Some of our old buddies may not be as comfortable communicating in the English language. So to ease out the navigation through our app, we will be providing multi-language support in various languages such as Hindi, Bengali and Marathi.
